Step 1:
    The initial state is the combination of qo and q3
    We call this q'0
From q'0:
    We then expand to two new states. Moving from initial state,
    if there is a 0 we move to a combination of q1, call this state q'1
    If it's a 1, then we get a combination of state q0, 
    call this state q'2
From q'1:
    From this state, if the next input is a 1, then we loop back
    to q'1. If the next input is a 0, then we move to a combination
    of q2, into a new state q'3
From q'2:
    From this state, if the next input is a 0, we transition to q'1
    If the next input is a 1, we loop back to q'2
From q'3:
    An input of 1 or 0 will loop back to q'3. This state is
    the only final state
